# Data visualisation using spotify top 100 list from 2010 to 2019

--DISLAIMER--

I genuinely could not understand what was going on so it was not done on time. I hope that my struggle at least gives me more than 0. If not completely understand that too. I will attempt it again at the end of the semester just for my state of mind. I cannot leave it like this but there is simply no time right now.
 
Goals:

Using csv file for Top spotify songs from 2010 - 2019 
- Different years throughout time (timeout function?) | didn't end up happening
- colours and shape denote different genres that were on the list | sort of ended up working but randomised every refresh 
- moves to the average bpm of the songs from that year? | didn't end up working

What I'm working on:
- making it look interesting | more like the bits in the background in that one scene in ratatouille

- ^^ It actually ended up looking very minimalist instead | just black and white

What is done: 
- cleaning up csv data
- making particles show up in varying sizes using genre column in table
