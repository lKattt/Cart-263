# Template p5 project

Data visualisation Main bits

Goals:

Using csv file for Top spotify songs from 2010 - 2019 
- Different years throughout time (timeout function?)
- colours and shape denote different genres that were on the list 
- moves to the average bpm of the songs from that year 

What I'm working on:
- making it look interesting | more like the scene in ratatouille 

What is done: 
- cleaning up csv data
- making particles show up in varying sizes using genre column in table
