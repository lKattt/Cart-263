# Template p5 project

Data visualisation Main bits

Goals:

Using csv file for Top spotify songs from 2010 - 2019 
- Different years throughout time (timeout function?) | didn't end up happening
- colours and shape denote different genres that were on the list 
- moves to the average bpm of the songs from that year?

What I'm working on:
- making it look interesting | more like the bits in the background in that one scene in ratatouille
